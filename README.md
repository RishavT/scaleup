# ScaleUp

Ideally you're here if you want to learn guitar scales and are bored/tired of looking for online tutorials, but you're welcome regardless of that :)

Also, we assume you know very basic guitar (can play a simple happy birthday tune, for example); and can read guitar tabs.

For starters, head over to the [Major Scale](scales/major.md)
